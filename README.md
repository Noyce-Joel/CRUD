##CRUD
My friends and I play a card game called Big Two every other weekend 🃏 ♠️

We've become tired of using the white board and taking photos to keep track of scores 😴 🥱

So I've been building out a CRUD app to keep track of the scores in our Big Two Leagues 😎

##Stack

NextJS

Apollo/GraphQL 🔥

MongoDB

(side-note: GraphQL is awesome. Love the way you can structure your queries to fetch limited data. Very cool.)

Run it locally on your development server

npm run dev
